Enterprise search search enterprise information by a defined audience.
Ability to locate relevant data with ease on enterprise information as you are used to with Google on www.

Google deserves the credit for elevating user expectations - power and simplicity of enterprise search.
Change in paradigm- convergence of capabilities- document and content management, business
 intelligence and making sense of what is residing in unstructured and structured data in internal 
and external sources.
Game changers- 
-big data – search engine that can scale 
-cloud computing – search as a cloud service


Search or Information retrieval remains a vital IT function- whether personal use or official use.
Current state- Employees are tired of inferior enterprise search solution.


Disrupters-
Big Data
cost of storage decreased - companies are not pruning data but looking at scalable search engines to meet the demand of data, also poor quality of data - duplicate data, corrupted files. Burden of data quality is now shifted to search engine. Less emphasis on organizing data.

Cloud adoption is going up- Search as a service. Cloud based platform that servers as Google for your documents paving the way for increased productivity.

Open source search engines- that continues to scale without  giving up reliability, relevancy or performance
Elastic search and Solr

Industry continues to grow spurred by both commercial needs as well as security challenges. 


User experience - context knowledge, Natural language, Speech recognition.
semantic understanding of both content and queries.

- Navigation based on metadata (IMF ex- org, location, type). Also based on document’s unstructured content
- results based on user context - location awareness, user profile, social, history of search (search based on deeper understanding of context or deep learning is just started)
- NLP - for best understanding user’s intension and even evolving into interactive experience such as Apple Siri, Google Now. 
- richer results than just a list of links. Finer grained - highlighted hits, doc viewing, more visual the better
- elements of knowledge management that add meaning to queries and results 
- lower tolerance of hassle - why do i have to ask just provide me info (proactive intervention)
- search all - documents, image, video. Image recognition as people are communicating visually
- entity centric (resolve the right ways entity can appear rather than search keyword)
- Search “everywhere” - all content - concurrent, comprehensive, instant across all repositories - database, documents, blobs, pdfs, compressed, office format files - intranet, internet, states content, dynamic content. Be able to prioritize different types of sources based on user context (user being able to dd sources - able to control information points)

Navigation based on metadata (IMF ex- org, location, type) - based on analysis of document’s unstructured content


Search engines handling more business process automation tasks - Ex: customer complaint - email or letter received - the engine will relate its contents and even provide answers and frame replies.


What we are proposing today can evolve into our future needs - roadmap for improving the relevancy of results??


Evolving - development towards the most effective ways to find conceptually relevant information.
