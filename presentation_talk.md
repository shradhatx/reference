#### some ways to start
- thank audience
- i'll get my first slide and jump right in
- purpose of the presentation 
  - first to level set on what is ...
  - what implication are to org...
  - what next steps are and some things you want to pursue..
  
I am going to start with very basic 
I am going to get little bit technical but not too much

Tokenization to establish the identity of things

Cryptographic one way hash MD5 for uniquely identifying a person, item etc. Very determinstic ie same input results in same hash code.

It takes input of any type Ex: usename+SSN+DOB that uniquely identifies an item, run through hash and get a hash digest. Hash digest is a fixed length and is used to reference the item.
Who owns the token - public private key is used to identify the person  Hash digest is used to reference the item.
Who owns the token is determined by public private key.


Composite tokenization  - to run the hash of parts through another hash 

A ledger is maintained Ex- this person owns this 
You can maintain a lineage to establish the tarnsaction Ex: this person bought this thing from thi sperson by noting ownership using hash code. A cryptographic truth is kept.

Blockchain is one such legder system.

Each consortium(with members) has its own blockchain.

Mathematical linked block chain of database is built by keeping the hash chain of previous and next record.

UTXO database

Smart contract is any code that is hash coded and kept in the database along with blockchain.
Ex: In bank context has basic values like amount of loan, interest rate,...etc
 
Smart contract can be used as stored procedures.

Uses:
Any contract can be turned into a smart contract executing business and legal logic shared between counter parties, Ex-
 >supply chain 
 >open exchanges for bonds, equities, loans, insurance
 >contract for labor, sale,..
 >identity, permissions

Challenges-
Security in depth - systems as well as in smart contract
How to work with existing systems
privacy
Identity and key management
Ops and mgmt need to be built in not as an after thought
Audit and analytics capabilities
